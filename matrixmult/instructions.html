            <h2>Honors thesis - Instructions</h2>
            
            <p>
                These instructions are rudimentary and not very well tested&mdash;I'm relying on
                vague memory in a lot of cases, so if you run into an error that's not mentioned
                below, contact me and I can help resolve it (and then add to the instructions for
                future reference!).
            </p>
            <h3>Get the source code</h3>
            <p>
                Source archives are available in <a href="matrixmult.zip">.zip</a> and
                <a href="matrixmult.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a> format. If you prefer using version
                control or would be interested in looking at the implementation history, you can
                also clone the <tt>git</tt> repository by running the following at the command
                line:
            </p>
            <pre>    $ git clone http://stanford.edu/~wmonroe4/matrixmult.git</pre>
            <h3>Install Python</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing you'll need to do is install Python, if you haven't already. I
                recommend grabbing the latest 2.x, 32-bit version from the
                <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Download page</a>. 64-bit versions and
                versions that start with "3" are unlikely to work correctly. You'll then want to
                install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files">setuptools</a>,
                which makes figuring out Python libraries immeasurably easier.
            </p>
            <h3>Install NumPy</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> is the first library you'll want to
                tackle. Windows and Mac users will probably want to get the binary from
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/">SourceForge</a>,
                which is pre-built so you don't have to deal with compiling C code for these
                operating systems. On Linux, I'm fairly sure that <tt>pip</tt> is the best option
                for installing NumPy:
            </p>
            <pre>    $ easy_install-2.7 pip
    $ pip install scipy</pre>
            <p>
                On all OSs, make sure this worked by starting Python and typing
            </p>
            <pre>    >>> import numpy</pre>
            <h3>Install SymPy and PuLP</h3>
            <p>
                With NumPy and setuptools in hand, you can install two more of the dependencies,
                <a href="http://sympy.org/">SymPy</a>
                and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pulp-or/">PuLP</a>.
                On Windows:
            </p>
            <pre>    > \Python27\Scripts\easy_install sympy
    > \Python27\Scripts\easy_install pulp-or</pre>
            </p>
                On Linux/Mac (these instructions should apply equally to both, although if Mac
                users run into issues, let me know):
            <pre>    $ easy_install-2.7 pulp-or
    $ easy_install-2.7 sympy</pre>
            <p>
                (If your version of Python isn&apos;t 2.7, change these commands accordingly and
                cross your fingers.) Now these commands should work:
            </p>
            <pre>    >>> import sympy
    >>> import pulp</pre>
            <h3>Install GLPK</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html">GLPK</a> has a
                <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/glpk.htm">binary
                installer for Windows</a>; after installing it, you should
                <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-15ZLK/">add
                GLPK's <tt>bin</tt> directory to your PATH</a> (probably something like
                C:\Program&nbsp;Files\GnuWin32\bin). On Linux it can typically
                be installed from official distro sources, e.g. on Ubuntu
            </p>
            <pre>    $ sudo apt-get install glpk</pre>
            <p>
                Mac users will probably have to
                <a href="http://hichenwang.blogspot.com/2011/08/fw-installing-glpk-on-mac.html">compile
                from source</a>, as far as I can tell. Another option is to instead try to use
                <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Clp/">COIN-OR's LP
                solver</a> (<a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp">home page</a>), which should
                also work smoothly with PuLP. The only change necessary should be to replace
                <tt>pulp.GLPK</tt> with <tt>pulp.COIN</tt> in <tt>solvers.py</tt>, but I haven't
                tested this.
            </p>
            <h3>Install NLopt</h3>
            <p>
                For <a href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt">NLopt</a>,
                once again Windows users have it easier&mdash;they can simply
                <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#nlopt">download an
                executable installer</a>. Others will have to install from source. Make
                sure Python and NumPy are installed, then download the source on the NLopt
                home page; you'll need to specify the shared library configuration to get it
                to play well with Python:
            </p>
            <pre>    nlopt-2.3$ ./configure --enable-shared
    nlopt-2.3$ make
    nlopt-2.3$ make install</pre>
            <p>
                If this completes successfully, you should be able to open NLopt in Python as
                well:
            </p>
            <pre>    >>> import nlopt</pre>
            <h3>Try it out!</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, try starting a search for omega:
            </p>
            <pre>    matrixmult\src> \Python27\python search.py</pre>
            <pre>    matrixmult/src$ python search.py</pre>

            <ul class="link_row">
                <li class="link_group"><h2></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="/"></a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
