Bring: lightsabers, ball, candy

Intro
    it's almost Halloween.
        ?who wants candy?
    What This Class Is About
        sure, it's a math class.
        but you don't have to take it.
        you can leave during the halfway break if you want.
        so it's my job to make it cool.
        take notes if you want, or you can just sit back and soak it in.
        but definitely tell me if I make a mistake (I will)
        and ask questions.  somebody ask a question right now.
            !candy!
            it's okay, you have two hours to get some
    !I lied!
        this stuff is actually called "linear algebra".
        !that name sucks!
            "linear"...that's like, lines, right?
            and, well, "algebra"...yuck.
        !words to impress your parents!
Vectors
    ?so, what's a vector?
    Interpretations
        !draw a vector on the board!
        Geometric
            it's an arrow.
        Analytic
            "Analytic Geometry"->WIP
            it's a bunch of numbers.
        Algebraic
            it's this thing that obeys these rules.
        Galactic
            !lightsaber!
    Operations
        Length
            ?what if space were non-Euclidean?
                "Euclidean space"->WIP
        Addition and subtraction
            just add the components.
            or do this thing with the arrows.
            either way is the same.
        ?wait, what about multiplication?
        Scalar multiplication
            ->WIP
            multiply a vector by a number.
            (does what you think it would do.)
        !but that's boring!
        Dot product
            xX + yY + zZ
            A B cos t
            how much two vectors "agree".
        Cross product
            multiplication trick
            how well two vectors define a plane.
            area of a parallelogram
        ?wait, what about division?
            umm...no, sorry.
            ?what does division even mean?
            there are infinitely many vectors that can give a specific cross
                    product.
            same with dot product.
            (but not scalar multiplication!  yeah, you can divide there.)
    Applications
        !video game programming!
            suppose you have this ball. and you want to see if it hits this
                    lightsaber.
                !throw the ball at me!
                saber vector x (ball - handle) = area of parallelogram
                    divide by length of lightsaber and you get distance
                ?how far is it along the blade?
                    you should ask, "how much do saber and disp agree?"
                    saber vector . (ball - handle) / length = along
                        0 < along < length => hits!
                        along <= 0 => ouch!
                        along >= 1 => missed me!
            what's a plane?
                suppose you're making a game with a sport where a ball can
                        bounce off arbitrary walls.
                a plane is defined by a normal vector (->WIP), perp to all
                        lines in the plane
                distance from plane = (loc - some point on plane) . normal

Matrices
    Solving systems of equations
        you did this in algebra I, and those of you more advanced in math know
                you keep doing it.
         a +  b + c = 100
         a - 2b     = 0
        -a +  b + c = 0
        symbols like this are boring.
        !say you have three gnomes trying to start an underpants company!
            their names are Albus, Bartholemew, and Corey.
            they're dividing up the profits.  the total has to be 100%:
                    a + b + c = 100
            Albus wants twice as much as Bartholemew.
                    a = 2b, so a - 2b = 0
            Corey wants however much Albus gets more than Barth.
                    c = a - b, so -a + b + c = 0
        solve it by substitution:
            a = 2b, 2b + b + c = 100, c = 100 - 3b, -2b + b + 100 - 3b = 0
                                                              100 - 4b = 0
            so b = 25, a = 50, c = 25
        !check this out!
            [ 1  1  1 | 100]
            [ 1 -2  0 |  0 ]
            [-1  1  1 |  0 ]
            you're allowed to: switch two equations
                               multiply any equation by a number
                               add two equations
                                   (subtract is just *-1, add)
                                [ 1  1  1 | 100]
                                [ 0 -1  1 |  0 ]
                                [ 0  2  2 | 100]

                                [ 1  0  2 | 100]
                                [ 0 -1  1 |  0 ]
                                [ 0  1  1 | 50 ]

                                [ 1  0  2 | 100]
                                [ 0 -1  1 |  0 ]
                                [ 0  0  2 | 50 ]

                                [ 1  0  0 | 50 ]
                                [ 0  1  0 | 25 ]
                                [ 0  0  1 | 25 ]
        !what you're really doing is solving an equation using matrices!
        Matrix multiplication
            ax + by = e      [a b][x] = [e]
            cx + dy = f  =>  [c d][y] = [f]

    Vectors and points
        you guys are used to representing a point by two numbers: (x, y)
        ?doesn't that look like a vector?
            points and vectors aren't that different.
            if you've got three numbers, you can imagine them being a point
                    in space.
            or you can imagine them as a vector.
            !you can even take the coordinates of a point and interpret them 
                    as a vector!
                ?what does this look like?
                put the point at the end of the arrow.  then the beginning is
                        at the origin.
                if you have an origin, points and vectors are really the same
                        thing.
    Dimensions and vector spaces
        ?what's a dimension?
            it's just a variable.  latitude, temperature, age, !amount of
                    cheese!, etc.
            ?so what does it mean to be three-dimensional, two-dimensional,
                    etc.?
                you have to have three (two) numbers to specify a location.
                in space, we specify three axes.
                    in linear algebra, this is called a "basis". (->WIP)
                    !draw a basis in 2-D!
        vectors are useful in all dimensions, but your space has to be linear.
            ?what does linear mean?
            intuitively, if two points are in the space, then the point
                    halfway between them is too.
            there's one more restriction: it must include the origin.
                this is a bit weird, but it makes doing the math really nice.
                usually you can just change your origin if you need to.
            point, line, plane, whole space.
            now see if you can imagine a 3-D "plane" in 4-D.
                mind-boggling, huh?
    Transformations of coordinate systems
        Rotation
            ?how do you rotate a vector in two dimensions?
                x_r = x cos t - y sin t    [x_r] = [cos t  -sin t][x]
                y_r = x sin t + y cos t    [y_r] = [sin t   cos t][y]
                !look at the columns here!
                to get a vector with the 1st column, multiply mat by <1, 0>
                            "            2nd column,        "        <0, 1>
                !we've got ourselves a new basis!
        Linear transformations (-> WIP)
            scaling - uniform, non-uniform
            reflection
                !just use negative numbers!
            shear and other weird ones
                !but they're still linear!
        Projection
            take two dimensions and smush them into one.
                !what you end up with doesn't cover the whole plane!
                    "Span" -> WIP
            take three dimensions and smush them into two.
            ?can we take this further?
