            <h3>Course description</h3>
            <p>
                Video games are probably the most fun and creative projects in the world of
                computer programming. It is not hard to get into computer programming with very
                little math background--lots of people pick up programming as a hobby before
                taking high school math--and many games (Tetris, chess, even Mario or Pokémon) can
                be programmed with only basic math skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the most successful games, however, take place in
                three-dimensional worlds. If you want to make a game like
                Minecraft, Skyrim, or Call of Duty (to name a few), there's one
                bit of math that can incredibly useful to know: vectors. This
                is a topic that is frequently glossed over in high school math,
                but shows up in a suprising variety of subjects. This class
                will cover some of the intuitions and applications of vectors
                that are needed to build video games, while along the way
                discussing the video game industry and computer science in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will be a lecture-style class; due to equipment and time
                constraints, we won't be able to do individual, "hands-on"
                programming, but the class will include bits of realistic code
                and some cool demos.  I'll put any code I write online so
                students can look at it after the class is over.
