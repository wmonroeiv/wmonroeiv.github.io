            <h3>Course description</h3>
            <p>
                Video games are probably the most fun and creative projects in the world of
                computer programming. It is not hard to get into computer programming with very
                little math background--lots of people pick up programming as a hobby before
                taking high school math--and many games (Tetris, chess, even Mario or Pokémon) can
                be programmed with only basic math skills. However, a lot of the most successful
                games take place in three-dimensional worlds. If you want to make a game like
                Halo, World of Warcraft, or Skyrim (to name a few), there's one bit of math that
                can incredibly useful to know: vectors. This is a topic that is frequently glossed
                over in high school math, but shows up in a suprising variety of subjects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan to talk in depth about the intuitions and applications of vectors for video
                games, and along the way discuss the video game industry and computer science in
                general. Due to equipment and time constraints, we won't be able to do individual,
                "hands-on" programming during class, but I promise to show bits of realistic code
                and give some cool demos. I'll put any code I write online so students can look at
                it after the class is over.
